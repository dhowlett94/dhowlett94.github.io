As a STEMNET Ambassador I have assisted in the running of weekly <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Clubs</a> in primary schools where children were taught how to write code, typically using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> initially. This involved engaging students by teaching it in a fun and creative way as well as making sure I explained the concepts in a way that children could understand. </p>

          <p class="content-para bottom">Microsoft Certified C# Developer. I'd used C# quite a bit at University but that hadn't introduced me to much more than the basics. As such, I started working towards the certification because I wanted to solidify my knowledge of the basics as well as build upon it by learning about some of the more complex language features. Working towards this also gave me an introduction to areas that I perhaps wouldn't have otherwise looked at, such as cryptography. I worked towards this in my personal time over course of several months before passing the exam in May 2015. <br> <br>
